```

## 📊 Version Management Going Forward

### To Update Version in Future:

1. **Update `version.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.1.0",
     "releaseDate": "2025-XX-XX",
     "releaseName": "Enhancement Release"
   }
   ```

2. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`:**
   ```markdown
   ## [1.1.0] - 2025-XX-XX
   ### Added
   - New feature description
   ```

3. **Commit and tag:**
   ```bash
   git add version.json CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Release v1.1.0 - Enhancement Release"
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Description"
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. **Frontend automatically updates** - Version badge reads from `version.json`

5. **Notify customers** - Email/dashboard announcement of upgrade

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### When Ready to Develop V2 Enhancements:

1. Work in `/functions/v2/` folder (fully isolated)
2. Follow workflow in `v2/README.md`
3. Test thoroughly before production integration
4. Update version number when merging to production
5. Notify customers after deployment

### Planned Enhancements (V1.1+):
- Career pattern detection (freelancer vs job-hopper)
- Confidence scoring for matches
- Improved CV parsing
- Qualitative AI analysis for shortlisted candidates
